# Essentia

Essentia is the project behind my personal website, joshhess.info. 
As of now, the website only includes social media links and a resume
page. In the future, I plan on adding a portfolio page and fleshing
out an actual about page. It turns out one of the hardest parts of doing
this is wrangling screenshots and information about all the projects I've 
worked on.

The project is made using Vue with Typescript. It's hosted in the cloude
using Google's App Engine, hence the App.yaml and cloudbuild.yaml files.
